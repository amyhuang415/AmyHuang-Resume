        <p class="lead mb-4">Welcome! My name is Amy and I am currently a sophomore at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently a Theatre, Film, and Digital Productions major, however, there may be plans to switch. At this moment, I am very interested in media and cultural studies as well. It is quite hard trying to figure out exactly what I want to pursue throughout college, especially since I feel like there is so so much that I want to do within this world, along with all the pressure that comes with it, of course. Besides my dilemma, I would love to minor in business management. 
<br><br>

        Growing up, I loved being on the computer and surfing the web, maybe because I am an only child and life at home gets a little boring sometimes! I remember being really fascinated with online games and YouTube videos. All the aesthetics and visuals present were extremely captivating. I have always wanted to take part in the creation and production of these aesthetics and videos that I watched on YouTube. Because of the internet, I grew so much curiosity towards technology and programming applications and how it all works. I remember begging my dad to buy me my first webcam, so that I can start filming my own videos and editing them. From there on, I would ask for a camera or speakers for either my Christmas or birthday present. I also started to build a passion for photography. I loved putting my visions to work and the best part is always the post-production; editing! It is kind of crazy because growing up, I would see how artistic my friends were and how well they could draw and create art and I would have never imagined myself to also have a creative side. I may not be able to draw or sketch amazing pieces, but I can definitely produce a film that captivates many individualâ€™s attention. It is crazy how much technology and the media can do for people!
<br><br>

        Besides my admiration for the media, broadcasting, and production side of things, I landed an on campus job at the Student Recreation Center (SRC) my first year. I work as a Fitness Attendant who maintains a safe, clean, and orderly environment within the weight room. I make sure to provide excellent customer service by assisting facility users, spotting individuals when necessary, and offering safe and useful recommendations to participants regarding their workout or use of equipment. It is probably unexpected and odd for many who sees me working at a gym and finding out that I love film or that I am a film major. However, sports have always played one of the biggest roles within my life growing up. I started playing on a sports team since the 6th grade and ever since then, I have always been active. Being an athlete can get really mentally and physically draining for so many reasons, but something about putting in all your ambition, time, and passion towards a team and sports that you love is so therapeutic and rewarding. I went from a girl who joined the volleyball team in middle school because she loved playing it during P.E. to the girl who became captain of both the junior varsity and varsity volleyball team, and flag football team of my highschool. Due to my 7 years of being an athlete, I grew the love to continue working out, staying in shape, and I am currently putting in a lot of my time asides from my education into weight lifting and learning more about fitness and nutrition.
